              <p>Triton</p>
              <p>Akra is a tough, hyper, reckless triton. She'll rush into battle, jump off wyverns, blow up volcanos, without really thinking it through at all.
                 She's a teal woman, with orange highlights. Her head is domed, metal rings pierced through various parts of it.
                A wave tattoo goes across the right side of her face. On her body she has several sun tatoos. She wears what resembles a sports bra, and shorts made of eel skin.
                A permanent burn mark is left by a brass pendant hung on her neck.  </p>

              <li>Heavy cloak to soak in water</li>

              <li><specialitem name="Sun Wraps"></specialitem>
Little mirrors woven into these wraps allow you to amplify your sun abilities in new ways. After you've spent at least 1 hours in daylight, you gain a shield of sunlight. Gain temporary health points equal to your monk level + WIS. You may recharge these points during a short rest.
When you hit a target using an unarmed strike, you may spend 1 Ki point to force   any targets within 5 feet of that creature to make a CON save (DC 15), or else they are blinded. Blinded enemies can attempt to make another CON save to end the condition at the end of each of their turns.</li>
            <li><specialitem name="Daybreak"></specialitem>
With these brass knuckles, unarmed strikes hurt a little more. You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls, and you deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage. When you shoot a sunblast and it hits a target, you can teleport yourself to anywhere within 5 feet of that creature.</li>
              <li><specialitem name="Sun monk scroll"></specialitem>
The scroll is written in an unknown language. It's characters appear to be based on circles and lines, like little suns with dots inside.
The scroll tells of the Order of the Sun, which arose in defiance against the rule of the Black Sage, who used the powers of shadow to oppress the Firstborn and allow the first Gascari towns to be established. The Order of the Sun were Firstborn who rose their arms up to the sky and meditated until they understood how to resist the Gascari. After the Black Sage had died, they rebelled against the Secondborn governors and they succeeded only in creating one nation for themselves, Basoor, a land with no ports, no resources, no trade routes. But there, in the Basooran Desert, under the sweltering heat of the sun, they learned patience. They began to share their knowledge with Thirdborn, the ones the Secondborn call Mistakes. But the Secondborn realized what this knowledge was doing, that it encouraged the Secondborn and Thirdborn to rebel once again, so they outlawed the Order of the Sun and murdered all of its leaders. Some fled south, some fled across the sea, and it is believed many went into hiding in Basoor.  Thus, the Order of the Sun scattered and faded from knowledge, its relics burned, sold, or fallen into the sea.

              <ul>
                <li>Akra's sister Kara was captured by the imperialist navy. She escaped and was last scene in the Daedryan ocean. Akra tied messages in bottles
                  to several sea critters and will check back on any news next time she is near the ocean.</li>
                  <li>The empire uses mind control, did this effect Kara? Was she effected by the undead issues of Deadrya?</li>
                  <li>Tritons have a mysterious path, that Akra did very bad at studying. She knows they were created by surfacers, will she find clues in her surface world explorations?<</li>
                  <li>How do surfacers eat cooked meat?</li>
                  <li>Moira's son was vampirified after her husband made a deal with a crone. Many children in Daedra are affected by a horrific wasting illness. Is there a source to this?
                    Does it connect to other issues?</li>
                    <li>Tempest's dad is the wind (one of the Winds?) that's weird...</li>
                  <li>Glaive keeps mentioning he's died before, that's weird...</li>
                  <li>There's a creepy, maybe undead guy, named Markus who we have to worry about.</li>
                  <li>The royal family of Deadra seems like something the Sun Monks would oppose. Akra is going to start organizing based on the Sun Monks against the Gascari.
                    The royal wedding is coming up, and she may do something against it</li>
